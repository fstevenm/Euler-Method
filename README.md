## Euler's Method - a numerical solution for Differential Equations

This is the code program [Python] for Euler's Method for solving differential equations.

Here is the example, i want to find the numerical solutions of this differential equations:
    
    dy/dx = f(x,y) = (x-y)/2

The numerical solutions would be present in a plot with it's exact solutions. This code program also would be show the numerical solutions, exact solutions, and error between numerical and exact by print the results of using Euler's Method.

#### This is the results of Euler's Method
